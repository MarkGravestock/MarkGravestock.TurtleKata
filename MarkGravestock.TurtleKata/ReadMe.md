##### Requirements for a Turtle

A turtle supports four instructions:
    
- Move some distance in the current direction.
- Turn a certain number of degrees clockwise or anticlockwise.
- Put the pen down or up. When the pen is down, moving the turtle draws a line.
- Set the pen color (one of black, blue or red).
